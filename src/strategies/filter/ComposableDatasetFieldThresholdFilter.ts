/**
 * ComposableDatasetFieldThresholdFilter<TData, TConfig>
 * ------------------------------------------
 * A reusable, generic filtering strategy that filters an array of objects based on numeric
 * threshold values defined per field. It implements the `FilterStrategy<TConfig, TData>` interface,
 * making it compatible with orchestrated scan or screening pipelines.
 *
 * üõ† HOW IT WORKS:
 * - The `config` defines minimum threshold values for one or more fields.
 * - For each item in the input array, the filter checks whether all specified fields
 *   meet or exceed their corresponding threshold.
 * - It returns only the items that pass all threshold checks.
 *
 * ‚úÖ USE CASES:
 * - Used in live market scan pipelines to filter tickers based on volume, price change %, etc.
 * - Plugged into the `MarketScanOrchestrator.run()` method as a composable field-based filter.
 * - Can be reused across other scanning or screening contexts, such as leaderboards or
 *   pre-market screeners, as long as the data is structured and numeric fields are present.
 *
 * üìç Called from:
 * - `runLiveMarketScannerTask.ts`: passed into `MarketScanOrchestrator` as part of the `DatasetScreenerConfig`.
 * - `MarketScanOrchestrator.ts`: receives the filter and executes it over snapshots returned by the quote scanner.
 *
 * üì¶ EXAMPLE CONFIG:
 * const config = {
 *   volume: 1_000_000,
 *   change_pct__nz_tick: 2.5
 * };
 *
 * const filter = new ComposableDatasetFieldThresholdFilter<NormalizedRestTickerSnapshot>();
 * const results = filter.runFilter(snapshots, config);
 *
 * üß© COMPOSABLE?
 * While named "Composable", this filter is primarily plug-and-play.
 * Composition in this context means it can be part of a broader filtering system like
 * `MultiscanFilterScreener`, but it does not currently support logical chaining (e.g., .and(), .or()).
