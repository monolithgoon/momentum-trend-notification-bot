/* ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   ü§ù Stage Contract
   - Each stage declares inputs it requires and outputs it produces
   - run() only sees its declared inputs; returns only its declared outputs
---------------------------------------------------------------------------- */

/**
 * üìò Semantic / Policy Notes
 *
 * - Purpose:
 *   The Stage contract enforces *information hygiene* in the pipeline:
 *   every stage must explicitly declare what it consumes (`input`) and
 *   what it produces (`output`). This avoids hidden dependencies, implicit
 *   side-effects, and context bloat.
 *
 * - Input/Output Discipline:
 *   1. `input` keys MUST correspond to properties in IPipelineContext
 *      that are required for the stage to operate.
 *   2. `output` keys MUST correspond to properties in IPipelineContext
 *      that the stage guarantees to populate.
 *   3. Anything not declared is invisible: a stage cannot "snoop" on
 *      unrelated context fields nor pollute the pipeline with extra values.
 *
 * - run() Policy:
 *   The `run` function receives ONLY its declared inputs (strongly typed).
 *   It MAY also see other context fields as `Partial<>` (optional), but
 *   must not rely on them ‚Äî this keeps contracts truthful and enforceable.
 *
 * - Type Naming:
 *   - Current: `I` (input keys), `O` (output keys).
 *   - Alternative: `TIn` / `TOut`.
 *     - ‚úÖ Pros: more explicit, easier for newcomers to parse.
 *     - ‚ö†Ô∏è Cons: slightly noisier in generic signatures.
 *   üëâ Policy: Both are valid; prefer `TIn`/`TOut` if prioritizing clarity
 *      in public-facing APIs, stick with `I`/`O` if prioritizing brevity
 *      in internal/core code. (If your team already found `I`/`O` confusing,
 *      go with `TIn`/`TOut`.)
 *
 * - Enforcement:
 *   - Contracts should be *total truth*: any drift between what a stage
 *     declares vs what it actually uses/produces must be caught in
 *     integration tests.
 *   - Stages are meant to be **pure transforms**: no global state, no hidden
 *     dependencies, only declared I/O.
 *
 * - Anti-Goals:
 *   ‚ùå Do not use `any` or `unknown` for I/O keys; defeats type safety.
 *   ‚ùå Do not mutate IPipelineContext directly inside `run`; only return the
 *      declared outputs.
 *   ‚ùå Do not overload contracts with validation/business rules; keep them
 *      declarative and minimal.
